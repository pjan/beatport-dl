# My Go Nix App

This project is a simple Go application that is built using Nix flakes. It demonstrates how to set up a Go project with Nix for dependency management and building.

## Project Structure

```
my-go-nix-app
├── main.go       # Entry point of the Go application
├── go.mod        # Module dependencies and configuration
├── flake.nix     # Nix flake configuration for building the application
└── README.md     # Project documentation
```

## Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.16 or later)
- Nix package manager with flake support enabled

## Building the Application

To build the application, run the following command:

```
nix build
```

This will use the `flake.nix` file to build the Go application and its dependencies.

## Running the Application

After building, you can run the application with:

```
./result/bin/my-go-nix-app
```
